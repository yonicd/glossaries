### Information Criteria

In statistics, the `r Gls('bic')` or Schwarz information criterion (also SIC, SBC, SBIC) is a criterion for model selection among a finite set of models; the model with the lowest `r gls('bic')` is preferred. It is based, in part, on the likelihood function and it is closely related to the `r Gls('aic')`.

When fitting models, it is possible to increase the likelihood by adding parameters, but doing so may result in overfitting. Both `r gls('bic')` and `r gls('aic')` attempt to resolve this problem by introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model; the penalty term is larger in `r gls('bic')` than in `r gls('aic')`

The `r gls('bic')` was developed by Gideon E. Schwarz and published in a 1978 paper, where he gave a Bayesian argument for adopting it.

### `r Glspl('turtle')`

The `r gls('po')` is the largest and deepest of Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic `r Gls('ocean')` in the north to the Southern `r Gls('ocean')` (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.

Sea `r gls('turtle')` live in the Nothern `r gls('po')` one or more life stages, from hatchling to adult. This includes green, loggerhead, olive ridley, leatherback, and hawksbill sea `r glspl('turtle')`â€”all of which are protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
